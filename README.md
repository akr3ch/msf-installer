Metasploit framework installation script.
> actually I was faceing some issue while installing metasploit framework on my new VPS. Then I found this script, which automates the whole process without any issue :)

One line installation
```
git clone https://github.com/akr3ch/msf-installer; cd msf-installer; bash ./msf-install.sh
```
